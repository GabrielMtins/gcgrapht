----------------------------------GCGRAPHT--------------------------------------
Name:
	gcgrapht - Generates a graph as a .tga file

Synopsis:
	gcgrapht [OPTION] ... [FUNCTION]

Description:
	Generates a graph as a .tga file
	If there is not a function, it will read the standard input

	-gs, --grid-size
		Selects the size of the grid of the graph
		Example: -gs 16x16

	-s, --size
		Selects the size of the image in pixels
		Example: -s 1024x1024

	-sg, --show-grid
		If true, show grid marks, if false, it doesnt show it
		Example: -sg false

	-lt, --line-thickness
		Set the thickness of the graph's line in pixels
		Example: -lt 4

	-gt, --grid-thickness
		Set the thickness of the grid marks in pixels
		The thickness of the x and y axis will always be doubled the thikcness
		of the grid
		Example: -gt 4

	-bg, --background
		Set the background color
		The color needs to be in hexadecimal
		Example: -bg 00FF00 (set the color to green)
		-bg FF0000 (set the color to red)

	-fg, --foreground

		The color needs to be in hexadecimal
		Example: -fg FF0000 (set the color to red)

	-gc, --grid-color
		Set the grid color
		The color needs to be in hexadecimal
		Example: -fg FF0000 (se the color to red)

	-ac, --axis-color
		Set the xy axis color
		The color needs to be in hexadecimal
		Example: -fg FF0000 (se the color to red)

	-ac, --axis-color
		Set the xy axis color
		The color needs to be in hexadecimal
		Example: -fg FF0000 (se the color to red)

	-o, --output
		Set the output file
		If not set, the output file will be image.tga

	-help
		Display a help message 

Examples:
	gcgrapht "2*x+1" - creates the graph of f(x) = 2x+1
	gcgrapht "x^2" -o graph.tga - creates the graph of f(x) = x^2 and saves it to the graph.tga file
